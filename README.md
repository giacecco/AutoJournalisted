# AutoJournalisted

## Summary
AutoJournalisted automatically and unattendedly sends all articles published by your favourite UK journalists (if not behind paywalls) straight to your [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) account. Moreover, if Instapaper is configured to forward all articles to your Kindle, you will be able to read the same on your e-reader! 

This is possible thanks to the guys at the [Media Standard Trust](http://mediastandardstrust.org/) whose service [Journalisted](http://journalisted.com/) monitors the journalists' activity and publishes references to their work through nice [APIs](http://journalisted.com/api). By the way, why don't you [thank them](http://www.justgiving.com/mediastandardstrust)?

## Installation
AutoJournalisted is designed to run unattended within a dedicated Google Drive spreadsheet. This means that you don't need a laptop or a "server" to run AutoJournalisted on: Google will host it for you for free!
